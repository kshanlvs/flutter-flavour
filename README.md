This flutter project container two differen flavours one for development and another for production.
Based on target selected by the user, user can switch between production flavour and development flavour

Inside main.dart file there is a bool variable  isDev which is set false and if it true  then the development mode will be executed else production mode will be executed.

For the development flavour the color of the app bar is orange and for the production mode the color for the app bar is grey



 I have used GetX architecture and GetX state management for managing state of the widget.

- Separating UI and business logic
- Separating model
- Dependency Injection
- Dio Interceptors  to handle server request and response
